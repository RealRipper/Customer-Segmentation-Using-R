        "- While using the k-means clustering algorithm, the first step is to indicate the number of clusters (k) that we wish to produce in the final output. The algorithm starts by selecting k objects from the dataset randomly that will serve as the initial centers for our clusters. These selected objects are the cluster means, also known as centroids. Then, the remaining objects have an assignment of the closest centroid. This centroid is defined by the Euclidean Distance present between the object and the cluster mean. We refer to this step as “cluster assignment”. When the assignment is complete, the algorithm proceeds to calculate the new mean value of each cluster present in the data. After the recalculation of the centers, the observations are checked if they are closer to a different cluster. Using the updated cluster mean, the objects undergo reassignment. This goes on repeatedly through several iterations until the cluster assignments stop altering. The clusters that are present in the current iteration are the same as the ones obtained in the previous iteration.\n",

        "- The k-means clustering method is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to identify clusters of data objects in a dataset.

The kth cluster’s centroid has a length of p that contains the means of all variables for observations in the kth cluster. We denote the number of variables with p.\n",

The Gap statistic standardizes the graph of log(Wk), where Wk is the within-cluster dispersion, by comparing it to its expectation under an appropriate null reference distribution of the data.\n",
        "- The gap statistic has been published by [R. Tibshirani, G. Walther, and T. Hastie (Standford University, 2001)](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/gap.pdf).\n",
        "- The ‘gap statistic’ for estimating the number of clusters (groups) in a set of data. The technique uses the output of any clustering algorithm (e.g. K-means or hierarchical), comparing the change in within-cluster dispersion with that expected under an appropriate reference null distribution.\n",
        "- Clustering is an important technique in Pattern Analysis to identify distinct groups in data. Due to data being mostly more than three-dimensional, we perform dimensionality reduction methods like PCA or Laplacian Eigenmaps before applying a clustering technique. The data is then available in 2D or 3D and this allows us to visualize the found clusters very nicely to humans.\n",

For example, we needed to introduce a new hyperparameter, namely the number of K for which the W_uniform is simulated on. We can’t be sure what the ideal value for this is. Furthermore, the random initialization of the centroids can lead to an over- or underestimation of K*.\n",
